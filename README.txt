This project serves as a personal portfolio and an interactive hobby survey, showcasing my background, interests,
and skills while engaging users to share their own. On the homepage, I introduce myself as a passionate student
deeply interested in robotics and software integration. I highlight my academic journey, including my dual degrees in
Computer Science and Robotics Engineering, and provide a detailed list of computer science courses I’ve completed at WPI.
This reflects my dedication to learning and growing in these fields. Additionally, I’ve included a table summarizing my
experience with various technologies, ranging from HTML and CSS to frameworks like React and Next.js, giving visitors a
clear view of my technical skill set.

The hobbies page adds an interactive element to the project. It allows users to participate in a survey where they can share
their hobbies and interests. I also list some of my personal hobbies, such as weightlifting, playing soccer, cooking, and hiking,
to connect with users on a personal level. The form includes options for users to describe their favorite hobbies, select categories
they enjoy, and specify how often and how much time they dedicate to their interests. This page not only makes the project engaging
but also highlights my ability to create functional and user-friendly web applications. This is a good base to improve my knowledge and
skill in web development, and will help me create more complex programs in the coming days.

Technical Achievements

    1. I styled my page using external stylesheets with new style rules. Here are all the
    style rules I incorporated: color palette, body styling, header styling, footer styling, table styling,
    table cells, and navbar links.   Each distinct style rule (e.g., background colors, font
    families, padding, alignment) contributes to the maximum 5 points for this requirement.

    2.

    3. I have utilized a variety of semantic HTML tags in my index.html file. Here is a list of the semantic tags used:
       <nav>: Defines the navigation bar for links.
       <ul> and <li>: Used for unordered lists to display navigation links and a list of courses.
       <h1> and <h3>: Used for headings to structure content.
       <p>: Used for paragraphs to display textual content.
       <table>, <thead>, <tbody>, <tr>, <th>, and <td>: Used to create a well-structured table for displaying technology experience.
       <title>: Defines the title of the webpage (displayed in the browser tab).
       <meta>: Provides metadata about the webpage, like character encoding.

Design Achievements

    1. I incorporated the design electives defined in styles.css have been incorporated into your index.html file. Here's how:

      Color Palette: The colors defined in :root are used throughout the design:
      --color-light-blue is applied as the background color of the body and table cells (td).
      --color-dark-blue is applied to the header, table borders, and the main <h1> heading.
      --color-medium-blue is used for the navigation bar and <h3> headings.
      --color-sky-blue is applied to the table headers (th).
      --color-steel-blue is used for the footer.

    2. I also used the below font from the Google Fonts page:
      Typography: The font family 'Lato', sans-serif is applied to the entire webpage, ensuring consistency in text appearance.
      Layout and Styling:
      The <nav> bar is styled with display: flex and justify-content: center for even spacing of links.
      The table is styled with border-collapse and padding, making it visually appealing and readable.
      Used the Roboto Font from Google Fonts: I used Roboto as the font for the primary copy text in my site.
